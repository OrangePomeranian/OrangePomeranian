👋 Hi, My name is Daria and I am a passionate student of Bioinformatics with 1 year experience in Data Analysis and Data Science.

👀 I’m great fan of foreign languages (currently working on German 🇩🇪 and Mandarin 🇨🇳 skills), cuisines 🥟 and cultures. I love reading literature in their native language 📖, listen to English and German music (Linkin Park and Rammstein fan here 🎸) - but still open to new foreign experiences 🤩. 

🌱 I am currently trying to "embrace" Python , R, SQL and visualization tools such as Excel, Power Bi and Tableau.

📫 Don’t hesitate to say hello at d.plewa24@gmail.com, on Linkedin or here! 👋
